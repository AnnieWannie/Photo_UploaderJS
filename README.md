**Use 'npm run uploader' in the terminal when working directory is at the root to initialize the website.**

A website that allows photos to be uploaded, saved, and retrieved.

Frontend created using ReactJS.

Backend created using NodeJS. 

ToDo list:
- [x] Add ability to retrieve photo files from server
- [x] Add photo upload preview
- [ ] Add styling
- [x] Add storing images via url

Bonus:
- [ ] Add video support
- [x] Add user registration
- [ ] Add security


#### Currently in the work ToDo 
Need to add functionality to fetch just the users images if desired **AND** images of **ALL** users if desired from the backend. Being able to fetch every image submitted by users would be fun and interesting along with adding a sense of community. *who am I kidding I'm the only one using this thing lol* 

***Dependencies on Concurrently, Nodemon, Multer, React, and Express***
